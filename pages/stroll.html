            <p>"Stroll" is a mobile application prototype I created with my team in HCDE 518. Stroll allows you to safely explore and discover points of interest in your neighborhood, and upload your own content and experiences to share with others in your community.</p>

                <p>My team worked remotely during the Autumn 2020 quarter. Our task was to create a product that impacts your health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this project, I worked on product, UX, and visual design. I also contributed to user research, programming (building the team's custom <a href="https://strolluw.github.io/StrollApp/">website</a>), and prototyping.</p>

                <p><b>The challenge:</b> Alleviate restricted mobility, travel, and exploration during the pandemic.</p> 
                <p><b>The question:</b> How can we utilize technology to promote neighborhood exploration, encourage physical activity, and create stronger connections between people and their communities during quarantine?</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>

                <p>Our research covered three methodologies including <i>Diary Studies, Surveys, and Competitive Analysis</i>.</p>

                <p>We invited 18 participants to walk around their neighborhood and take pictures of interesting things they encountered. We wanted to use this information to determine if our participants were curious about random things in their neighborhood and to detect themes in what they found interesting (examples below).</p>

                
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">

                </div>
                      

                
                <p>We then followed-up with the participants to complete a survey. We found that participants felt <i>getting outside</i> for a walk is beneficial to their mental health, they typically<i>explore their neighborhood weekly</i>, and that <i>connecting with the local community</i> is important.</p>
                
                <div class="stats">
                    <table>

                            <td>94%</td>
                            <td>78%</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>felt getting outside was important to their mental and physical health during Covid-19</td>
                            <td>reported importance in being connected to their community</td>
                            <td>explored their neighborhood at least weekly, either by walking or biking</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>    
                </div>

                <p>Through Competitive Analysis, I researched apps with similar functionalities (navigation, maps, mixed reality) and content-types (reviews, user generated content, landmarks, hashtags) that we wanted to include in Stroll.</p>

                <p>The primary applications we investigated were <i>Google Maps, Like a Local, and World Brush</i>.</p>

                <h2>Personas</h2>

                <p>After reviewing our research, we created multiple primary and secondary user personas to highlight key behaviors we anticipated from our users. Based on our researcher, we created <b>Wanda Wanderer</b> to be our primary user persona since all of our participants enjoyed wandering their neighborhoods and discovering new points of interest.</p>

                <p>Our synthesized design vision determined that Stroll should foster a <i>sense of belonging</i> by helping people feel more connected to their community, should encourage users to <i>get outside</i> in support of physical and mental wellness, and help users, who are passionate about their community, to <i>easily create and share content</i>.</p>

                <h3>Mid-fidelity Design and Journey Map</h3>

                <p>This is an example of one of my mid-fidelity prototype/user flows. This flow focuses on our "Creator" pathway, in which a user is uploading their own content to a "Pin" or point of interest that users can interact with to explore and learn more about their neighborhood.</p>

                <h3>Feedback and Iterations</h3>

                <h4>01. On-screen Live Map</h4>
                
                <p>Users loved the combination of an Augmented Reality (AR), real-time view. However, users thought the location marker looked like a video ‘play’ button, and once you click into a pin they were unsure what to do next. Also, they were unsure why the pin was called 'Space Needle' when it wasn’t directly on it.</p>
                
                    <a href="/assets/images/stroll/iteration3.png"><img src="/assets/images/stroll/iteration3.png" alt="design iteration, on-screen live map" width="100%" id="iteration"></a>

                <p> <b>Changes: Adjusted location marker, made CTA language more clear, and added elements to display the pin is user-generated.</b></p>

                <h4>02. Pin Profile Page</h4>
                <p>Once you get close to the pin, users were confused and one commented that the UI for our arrival screen looked like an ad.</p>

                    <a href="/assets/images/stroll/iteration2.png"><img src="/assets/images/stroll/iteration2.png" alt="design iteration, pin profile page" width="100%" id="iteration"></a>
                
                <p><b>Changes: Changed the location marker to reflect the pin itself, to maintain consistency. We also changed the layout of the expanded pin to compliment the ‘Start Walking’ screen.</b></p>

                <h4>03. User Onboarding</h4>
                <p>Users felt like they were unclear about the app's capabilities when they arrived to the home screen. We needed to make our onboarding very clear so the user knows functions like navigating to "Pins" and how they can share their own content. Users also found themselves trying to swipe to the next screen rather than tapping the 'Next' button.</p>

                    <p><b>Changes: Redesigned the onboarding experience to include more action oriented language to descibe the app’s core functions. The new design also switched from tapping ‘Next’ to navigate to the proceeding screen to a drag motion.</b></p>
